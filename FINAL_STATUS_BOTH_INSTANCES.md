**Impact**: High confidence in test suite

### Short-Term Priority: Expand Coverage
**Why**: Need 80% for institutional-grade quality  
**How**: Create Factor, Data, Scanner tests  
**Impact**: 25% → 60-70% coverage

### Medium-Term Priority: E2E and Performance
**Why**: Validate full system integration  
**How**: Browser tests, load tests, monitoring  
**Impact**: Production confidence

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Test infrastructure is solid
- Critical modules already tested
- Scanner performance validated
- Clear path to 80% coverage

### Medium Risk 🟡
- Need to maintain test quality as we add more
- Some modules harder to test (data layer, scanner core)
- API mocking adds complexity

### Mitigation:
- Continue with high-quality test patterns
- Use comprehensive fixtures
- Add mocks incrementally
- Regular coverage reviews
