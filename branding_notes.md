# Technic brand snapshot

## Core idea
Precision + growth, distilled. A minimalist “arrow-in-a-tile” symbol paired with a clean wordmark signals a personal quant that’s confident and modern.

## Palette
- Brand primary (growth neon): `#b6ff3b`
- Positive: `#9ef01a`
- Negative: `#ff6b81`
- Surfaces: charcoal/blacks (`#02040d`, `#0a1020`)
- Text: `#e5e7eb`

Use one hero accent (primary) on CTAs/highlights; keep backgrounds neutral/dark for contrast.

## Typography
- Wordmark/UI headings: Inter / SF Pro / system sans
- Body: same stack for consistency; favor bold weights for labels, medium/regular for body.

## Logo/mark
- Symbol: angled tile with a white inner stroke forming an upward blade/arrow (growth + precision). See `assets/brand/logo-symbol.svg`.
- Wordmark: “Technic” uppercase, tight letter-spacing; “Personal Quant” as secondary line.
- Keep clear space around symbol equal to its width; avoid stretching/rotating beyond the default -6° tilt.

## Usage rules
- Preferred lockup: symbol + wordmark + tagline on dark background.
- Monochrome: all-white or all-black for constrained contexts.
- App icon: symbol only, centered, on dark or neon background.
- Buttons/CTA: neon gradient; avoid multiple accent colors.

## Assets
- Symbol SVG: `assets/brand/logo-symbol.svg`
- Lockup SVG: `assets/brand/logo-lockup.svg`
- PNG icons: run `python scripts/export_icons.py` (needs `cairosvg`) to export 64/128/180/256/512px PNGs to `assets/brand/png/`


## Voice
Confident, concise, mentor-like. Avoid hype; emphasize clarity and actionability.
