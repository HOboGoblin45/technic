# How to Read a Technic Idea

Each Technic row/card is a fully specified trade idea: a signal plus a basic trade plan. Here’s how to interpret each field:

- **Symbol** — The ticker symbol for the idea.
- **Signal** — Qualitative label such as “Strong Long”, “Long”, “Avoid”, indicating bullish/neutral/avoid stances.
- **TechRating** — Composite technical/factor score (roughly 0–30+). Higher means a stronger setup by our scoring model.
- **AlphaScore** — Optional ML/model-based alpha prediction, normalized. Higher implies better expected edge when available.
- **Entry** — Suggested entry price/region (approximate; not a guarantee of execution).
- **Stop** — Suggested protective stop level to bound downside and size risk.
- **Target** — Initial profit target used to frame reward vs. risk.
- **Reward/Risk (RR)** — Targeted reward per unit of risk based on entry/stop/target.
- **Rationale** — 1–3 sentence explanation of why the idea scored well (e.g., momentum strength, attractive value, favorable regime).
- **Option idea (if present)** — A simple call or vertical spread aligned with the same thesis, with defined risk/reward.
